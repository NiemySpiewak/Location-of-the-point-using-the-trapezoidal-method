#🚀 2D Point Location using the Trapezoidal Map Method 🚀
Welcome to the 2D Point Location project! 👋
This project implements the trapezoidal map method to locate a point in a 2D plane using a randomized incremental algorithm. 🗺️
The program allows you to manually input segments, generate random segments, and visualize the process of building the trapezoidal map and locating a point. 🎨
